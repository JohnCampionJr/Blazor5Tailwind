# Blazor5Tailwind
A Blazor Wasm App with the following (these are the goals)
- Tailwind Integration
- Including PostCSS
- Tailwind in separate project as I don't want to clutter up Blazor app with node/npm/config files
- Recreate Blazor demo style with Tailwind
- Production tree-shaking of Tailwind

The goal of this is to learn tailwind and end up with it fully integrated with Blazor.
